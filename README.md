# se_project_react

This is a web app built to practice and show my skills in using React, a popular tool for making websites. The goal was to make a site that looks good, works on any device (phone, tablet, or computer), and loads quickly.

## What I Did

- **Started with React:** Used Create React App to set up the project easily.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Made sure everything looks good on big and small screens.
- **Easy-to-Read Code:** Broke the website into small pieces called “components,” so the code is neat and organized.
- **Navigation:** Set up different pages that you can click through, like a real website.
- **Fetched Data:** The app can get information from the internet and show it to you (update this with your real feature).
- **Tested in Browsers:** Checked the site in different browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge) to make sure it always works fast.

## Results

This project helped me learn how to build web apps that work everywhere and look nice.  
Everything runs smoothly, loads fast, and there are no extra comments in the code.

## Ideas for the Future

- Add more features, like letting users sign in or save their favorite items.
- Make the app even faster and more accessible for everyone.
- Put the site online so anyone can visit it.
- Collect feedback and data on how people use the app to make it better.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
